## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Sass/CSS
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Visual Studio Code


### What I learned

Another time spent on playing with CSS Grid, along with flexbox ðŸ˜Ž

### Continued development

I am not satisfied with the clean code issues, right order, code looks quite messy IMO, also I want to write media queries more neatly ðŸ˜£ And next time my git abilities will also get better (e.g. two branches instead of one)
